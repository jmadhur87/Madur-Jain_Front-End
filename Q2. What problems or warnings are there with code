. There are a few problems and warnings in the given code:

i)	The prop types of the items prop of the WrappedListComponent component are not defined correctly.

iii)	The onClickHandler prop of the SingleListItem component is not defined correctly. Instead of onClickHandler(index), it should be () => onClickHandler(index) to prevent the function.
iv)	The isSelected prop of the SingleListItem component is not passed correctly. Instead of isSelected={selectedIndex}, it should be isSelected={selectedIndex === index}.
